# 🧠 ImagineCrypto

**A Symbolic, Quantum-Aware Cipher Built on Imaginary Phase Collapse**

ImagineCrypto is a novel cryptographic primitive that encodes meaning using **geometric symmetry, complex roots, and imaginary phase rotations** — not traditional bitwise logic. It is designed to resist brute-force decryption by collapsing phase ambiguity into a mathematically secure one-way function.

> 🔐 *This cipher doesn’t just encrypt data — it encrypts the geometry of meaning.*

## 🔑 Core Idea

Each letter is mapped to a unit complex phase \( z = e^{i\theta} \), then encrypted by:

\[
c = -z^2 \cdot e^{i\phi}
\]

Where:
- \( \theta \) is derived from the letter
- \( \phi \) is a secret phase key
- The square operation and negative sign introduce **non-invertible ambiguity** (± root symmetry)

Without knowing \( \phi \), the original letter is **buried in collapse geometry** — and practically unrecoverable.

## 📊 Features

- ✅ **One-way collapse function** — 1000 brute-force tests confirm max entropy
- ✅ **Quantum-aware design** — symbolic phase encryption works in post-QC models
- ✅ **Root-based confusion** — ± ambiguity at the geometric level
- ✅ **Minimal, elegant code** — no SHA, RSA, AES — just math
