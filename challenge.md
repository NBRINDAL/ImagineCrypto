# 🔐 Public Ciphertext Challenge

Can you recover the **original 8-letter message** encrypted with ImagineCrypto?

### Ciphertext Set:
1: -0.841308 - 0.540557j  
2: -0.493732 - 0.869614j  
3:  0.803761 - 0.594952j  
4:  0.946224 + 0.323511j  
5: -0.207098 + 0.978320j  
6:  0.946224 + 0.323511j  
7: -0.493732 - 0.869614j  
8: -0.638024 + 0.770016j

> These were encrypted using the ImagineCrypto cipher:
>
> \[
> c = -z^2 \cdot e^{i\phi}, \quad z = e^{i\theta}
> \]
> All letters used the **same secret phase key** \( \phi \). The original message is unknown.
